I did alot of research before I even started so syncing with the api was never much a problem.

my first real problem came when it came to needing more classes for everything to function properly
I started off making a pokemon.cs and then mainly used it for my hub of classes

second problem consisted of pulling the pokemon types, I had to go through alot of stacks and other search engines to figure out the to get both typings id need to make the types with the [] so it could hold both types and with a foreach loop easily display those.

third main problem came with ability, it was basically the same as Type so I didnt think much of it, until it was unable to display hidden typing for pokemon, after some more research on PokeAPI websites, i learned i just needed to include a is_hidden tab to be able to pull out those as well.

all in all was not too hard of a lab, it was fun playing around with pulling from an api and I did not have to create a list of pokemon or use a predetermined database to pull from with everything in there.

I would love to work more on this, however I do not have the time to continue working on this, and honestly I would prefer working on this more as a API project rather than just in c#
